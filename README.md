# RealPLN Token

**RealPLN** is an inflation-resistant utility token that represents the real purchasing power of 1 Polish złoty from the year 2020. It aims to provide an easy-to-use, transparent digital currency that helps users preserve value over time.

## 🔍 What is RealPLN?

RealPLN is a synthetic stable token that tracks the inflation-adjusted value of the Polish złoty. Rather than maintaining a fixed 1:1 peg to the nominal złoty, it reflects the currency's real value, adjusted monthly based on official CPI (Consumer Price Index) data published by GUS (Poland’s Central Statistical Office).

The project was born out of a desire to build a tool for:
- **Hedging against inflation**
- **Improving economic literacy**
- **Promoting real-value thinking**

## 💡 Key Features

- 🎯 **Inflation-indexed**: Reflects the value of 1 PLN from 2020 based on CPI.
- 🌍 **Built for transparency**: Designed to educate and empower users.
- 🛡️ **Minimal volatility**: Offers a digital reference for long-term value stability.

## 🧮 How It Works

1. RealPLN starts at 1.00 PLN (2020).
2. Monthly, CPI data is used to calculate updated value in nominal PLN.
3. Users can view the real-time value on a dashboard (planned).
4. The token can be used for saving, smart contracts, and financial education.

Example: If cumulative inflation from 2020 to 2025 is 40%, then:
```
1 RealPLN ≈ 1.40 PLN (nominal)
```

## 🔗 Use Cases

- Freelance or contract pricing in real terms
- Smart contracts with inflation-adjusted logic
